## Robotic studio
In this hands-on studio training, I engaged in the complete robot design process “from A to Z,” covering kinematics, industrial design, manufacturing, electronics, simulation, and programming. I worked on designing and constructing an organic-looking legged robot, utilizing up to eight serial bus revolute servomotors with a 240-degree range.

My robot incorporated a rechargeable battery and a single-board computer as a controller, and I explored integrating accessories like a touchscreen display, a camera, and an accelerometer. I focused on creating a walking robot and experimented with additional functionalities, such as enabling the robot to perform unique movements. I also used evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization methods such as NSGA-II to optimize my control patterns, aiming to maximize my robot's movement speed. The outcome was a visually striking and functional robot suitable for showcasing in an online portfolio.
