## Evolutionary robotics
In the evolutionary robotics project, we aim to use evolutionary algorithms to design a robot made of mass and springs. I first built a simple spring-mass physics simulator to evolve our robots, and then the robot evolves by combining different structures and varying the extension cycles of the springs. The goal is to find a robot that can move in a specified direction.
