Graded problem sets and exams covering topics such as frequency response, loop shaping design, state-space analysis, and full state feedback, guiding students in analyzing and designing linear feedback control systems.

Held office hours to support students in mastering Laplace transforms, Bode plots, and various stability criteria, and assisted in MATLAB simulations for modeling and homework.

Organized and facilitated lab sessions where students implemented full-state feedback control on an inverted pendulum system, providing hands-on experience with control theory concepts and practical applications.
