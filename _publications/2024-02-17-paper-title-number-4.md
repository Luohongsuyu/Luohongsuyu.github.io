Sinusoidal undulation has long been considered the most successful swimming pattern for fish and bionic aquatic robots. However, a swimming pattern generated by the hair clip mechanism may challenge this knowledge. HCM is an in-plane prestressed bi-stable mechanism that stores elastic energy and releases the stored energy quickly via its snap-through buckling. When used for fish robots, the HCM functions as the fish body and creates unique swimming patterns that we term HCM undulation. With the same energy consumption, HCM fish outperforms the traditionally designed soft fish with a two-fold increase in cruising speed. We reproduce this phenomenon in a single-link simulation with Aquarium. HCM undulation generates an average propulsion of 16.7 N/m, 2-3 times larger than the reference undulation (6.78 N/m), sine pattern (5.34 N/m/s), and cambering sine pattern (6.36 N/m), and achieves an efficiency close to the sine pattern. These results can aid in developing fish robots and faster swimming patterns.
