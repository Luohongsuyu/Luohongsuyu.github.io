My name is Suyu Luohong, currently a second-year graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from both Sichuan University in China and the University of Pittsburgh in the United States, where I also completed a minor in Computer Science. My current research interests lie in computer vision, machine learning, and mechanical simulation.

I am currently involved in the bistable compliant fish robots project at Professor Hod Lipson's Creative Machines Lab. My primary responsibilities include motion modeling of the fish robots and fluid dynamics simulation.

You can find my CV here: [Suyu Luohong's Curriculum Vitael](../assets/Curriculum Vitae.pdf).
